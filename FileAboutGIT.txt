- Master::Repository: a place for storing things. With Git, this means your code 
  folder.

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Bone::Head: A “pointer” to the latest code you were working on.

- BThree::Commit: An action to save the current state — such that one can revisit 
  this state if needed.

- bTwo::Add: An action to ask Git to track a file.

- Master::Remote: A repository that isn’t local. Can be in another folder or in 
  the cloud (for example: Github): helps other people to easily collaborate, as 
  they don’t have to get a copy from your system — they can just get it from the
  cloud. Also, ensures you have a backup in case you break your laptop.
